App data

Code review
- Indent, indent, indent! 2 spaces per tab. The code is unreadable for now...
- Remove all debugging messages
- The usage of tabs doesn't correct, I am unable to move the App window.
- App window fades away automatically even before I can take an action on it.
- contextAction should not be hooked if its not going to be used
- Move all credentials, constants to top of codebase
- Follow camelCase for all variable names and CapitalizedCamel case for all class names
- Use some-dom-id case for naming any dom id's or classes
- Use spaces after , (comma) or + (plus)
- Use atleast 3 new lines before a new function definition
